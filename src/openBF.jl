# __openBF__ is a computational library written
# in [Julia](julialang.org) for blood flow simulations
# in straight elastic arteries. Navier-Stokes equations are reduced
# to 1D form and solved along the longitudinal direction. Numerical
# solution is achieved via a first-order finite volume solver
# based on the Godunov' method. For an usage example refer to
# [main.jl](main.html) file and its documentation.

# ### Import external libraries

# [__Roots__](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Roots.jl) "contains
# simple routines for finding roots of continuous scalar functions
# of a single real variable." It is used for the solution of interface
# problems in [conjunctions.jl](conjunctions.html) and
# [bifurcations.jl](bifurcations.html).
# using Roots

# [__Graphs__](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Graphs.jl) "is a
# Julia package that provides graph types and algorithms."
# It is used for arterial tree parsing and described in
# [utilities.jl](godunov.html#solveModel).
using Graphs

# [__ProgressMeter__](https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl)
# provides a simple implementation of a loading bar to be shown while
# running the solution.
using ProgressMeter

# [__PyCall__](https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl)
# "provides a @pyimport macro that mimics a Python import statement: it
# imports a Python module and provides Julia wrappers for all of the functions
# and constants therein, including automatic conversion of types between Julia
# and Python." It is used to import
# [`scipy.signal`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html)
# which is used in [check_convergence.jl](check_convergence.html).
# using PyCall
# @pyimport scipy.signal as signal
# using DSP

# ### Import openBF' files

# OpenBF' own types are contained in [BTypes.jl](BTypes.html) where
# data structures for vessels, blood, and numerical scheme
# are specified.
using BTypes
# using Printf
# using DelimitedFiles


# Data structures and output files are initialised at the beginning
# of each simulation. [initialise.jl](initialise.html) contains all
# the functions needed to read model description and the
# global settings.
include("initialise.jl")

# Inlet and outlets boundary conditions are applied at each time step,
# and vessels extremity nodes are updated with functions defined in
# [boundary_conditions.jl](boundary_conditions.html).
include("boundary_conditions.jl")

# Interface problems (junctions and bifurcations) are solved via the
# method of characteristics. The function in
# [junctions.jl](junctions.html) discriminates between
# [conjunctions](conjunctions.html) and
# [bifurcations](bifurcations.jl), and calls the appropriate solver.
include("junctions.jl")
include("conjunctions.jl")
include("bifurcations.jl")

# [godunov.jl](godunov.html) contains Godunov' method functions.
include("godunov.jl")

# [MUSCL.jl](MUSCL.html) is where the MUSCL method is implemented.
include("MUSCL.jl")

# Conversions from pressure to cross-sectional area (and vice versa),
# or from cross-sectional area to wave speed (and vice versa) are
# handled by functions in [converter.jl](converter.html); Riemann
# invariants are computed in the same location as well.
include("converter.jl")

# Input and output writing functions are stored defined in
# [IOutils.jl](IOutils.html).
include("IOutils.jl")

# Convergence check functions are all defined in [check_convergence.jl](check_convergence.html).
include("check_convergence.jl")
